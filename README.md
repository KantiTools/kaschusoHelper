# kaschusoHelper
KaschusoHelper (Working Title) is an extension which is supposed to help students of the KSSO in regards to the IT infrastructure.

### Features:
- Show the sum of the lowest five grades on the grades page
- Show the grade average on the grades page

### FAQ:
- Why is there no chrome version?
- Because google is not letting us distribute the extension ourselves without jumping through several hoops, and to publish on the web store, they want money from us. If you want to install it for chrome anyways, download the chrome branch of this repository (and unzip it), open chrome://extensions, enable "Developer Mode" at the top right, and select "load unpacked extension". Then, open the only directory inside of the unzipped directory.

- Did you just make the FAQ section to rant about google?
- Yes.
